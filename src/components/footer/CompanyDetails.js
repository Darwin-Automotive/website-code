          Hybrids and electric vehicles are the future believe it or not. A pedal assist e-bike has a potential to change the way we travel and which in turn creates a healthy environment.
          A mild-steel chassis prettified with a motor, modularized electronics and our passion we came up with a project “MARK IV” an e-bike which is one of its kind.
          <br></br>
          With aesthetically pleasing looks and modularized technology MARK IV is driven by 250 w brushless AC synchronous motor which gives you that power to ride at ease even at toughest roads. A 12 Amp off board fast charger energizes this bike within 2hrs, promising a range of 40 km and claiming a top speed of 48 kmph.
